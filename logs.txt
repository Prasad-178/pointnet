Downloaded dataset by the given commands
Then I fixed some errors in the code, and trained the model using the commands given, the results are given below

Training 1 :
  -> Type - classification
  -> Dataset - shapenet
  -> Epochs - 2
  -> len(dataset) = 12137
  -> len(test dataset) = 2874
  -> Final Accuracy (of test dataset) - 0.928

Testing 1 :
  -> Model - the model trained above was used (cls_model_1.pth)
  -> Dataset - shapenet
  -> Number of points tested on = len(test dataset)
  -> Final Accuracy - 0.927 (obviously same as above)

Training 2 :
  -> Type - segmentation
  -> Dataset - shapenet
  -> Epochs - 2
  -> len(dataset) = 2658
  -> len(test dataset) = 704
  -> Number of segmentation classes = 4
  -> Final Mean IoU for Chair (of test dataset) - 0.602
